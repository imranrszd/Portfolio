            <p class="description">
                CSC126 is subject on Fundamentals of Algorithms and Computer Problem Solving. This course introduce me
                to C++ programming language and teaches me the fundamental of it. Mind you this is not my first
                programming language, that is probably why I find it easy to code in C++. <br><br>

                For the group assignment of this course me and my coursemate decide to make a system that can help
                people to buy ticket from the cinema. Itâ€™s a simple and understandable concept. <br><br>

                We try to make it as complex as possible and did mind you we are just still a beginner in programming
                that is why we are super glad of the final product.
